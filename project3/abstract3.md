## Tutorial: Using Deep Learning and CNNs to make a Hand Gesture recognition model

### Filipe F. Borba

The goal of this project is to train a Machine Learning algorithm capable of classifying images of different hand gestures, such as a fist, palm, showing the thumb, and others. The method used was Deep Learning with the help of Convolutional Neural Networks based on Tensorflow and Keras. In the end, the algorithm successfully classifies different hand gestures images with enough confidence (>95%) based on a Deep Learning model.
