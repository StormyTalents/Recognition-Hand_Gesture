# Hand gesture recognition using Machine Learning

#### Filipe F. Borba

I'm planning to work with the [Hand Gesture Recognition Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/gti-upm/leapgestrecog/version/1) acquired by Leap Motion. I have already downloaded it from Kaggle. The only ethical concerns towards this data is giving proper credits and using the correct citation, presented by the authors in the dataset page.

The goal of the project is to train a Machine Learning algorithm capable of classificating images of different hand gestures, such as a fist, palm, showing the thumb, and others. I expect to use some kind of unsupervised learning, such as Convolutional Neural Networks, provided by Tensorflow and Keras, as well as Scikit-Learn as backup.
